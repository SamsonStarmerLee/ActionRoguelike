# ActionRoguelike

My complete project for Tom Looman's "[Professional Game Development in C++ and Unreal Engine](https://courses.tomlooman.com/p/unrealengine-cpp)" course.

Here are the major project features, taken from the course site:
* Building C++ Game Framework
* Combining C++ and Blueprint for flexible game logic
* Unrealâ€™s Gameplay Systems
* Event-based Programming Principles
* AI Programming (Behavior Trees, Blackboard, EQS, Custom C++ Nodes)
* Multiplayer Networking (Replication architecture, low-bandwidth, best practices)
* Saving Game State to Disk (Saving/loading player progression and world state)
* Performance Profiling Tools (Unreal Insights & in-editor tools)
* User Interfaces with UMG (using Event-based Principles)
* Async Asset Loading & Soft References

The course is arranged as a series of tutorials interleved with assignments, so of course my code diverges from his somewhat. The project is mostly created in c++, but there is some blueprint being used here as well; particularly around the AI features.
